# it downloads files i guess

script i wrote to quickly download all the pdf's from a public web page to the current directory instead of manually clicking each of them. should work for other stuff too though as long as its all the same kind of file

not a lot of documentation cuz i threw it together pretty quickly and dont plan on maintaining it.


## usage

`python3 parse.py [url to parse] [file extention of files to download]`
